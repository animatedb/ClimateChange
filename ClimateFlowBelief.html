If you got here, I assume this means that the climate may or may not be changing, but nothing
needs to be done about it.

In many cases, actions that an individual can take to help reduce the chance of climate change
also correlate to the individual saving money. Many costs go along with the amount of energy
used to create a purchased good or product.

<h3>Only corporations or governments can help</h3>
The purchasing power of individuals impacts corporations. There are also other indirect
mechanisms such as insurance. One example:

Changing opinions, educating people, and changing government regulations can have many effects.
Climate change is dependent on actions of billions of people and millions of organizations.

The average American generates 4 times the amount of some countries and many more times
than that of other countries. In other words an American can reduce the most sometimes
quite easily. Nearly everybody can make choices about what to purchase.

<!-- The chart does not directly link to the following -->

<a name="HowMuchWillTemperatureRise"></a>
<h3>How much will temperature rise</h3>
The temperature rise is impossible to exactly predict because it depends on so
many factors such as the falling costs of solar panels and batteries, possible
carbon capture technologies, political changes, etc. 
<p>
One way to understand it is to try the
<a href="https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html?v=2.7.6">
MIT EN-ROADS simulator</a>.
<p>
The best chart I have seen to understand temperature rise is the probability
density curve by Wagner&Weitzman that can be found here.
<a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/climate-change/">
80000hours.org/problem-profiles/climate-change/</a>.

This graph shows that if humans do not mitigate climate change, there is about a
10% chance that the temperature could be above 5 degrees C. This graph shows
that lower than .8 degrees rise has zero probability because the rise has already
been above .8 degrees. This shows that the most likely rise is about 3 degrees C
(5.4 degrees Fahrenheit), but this is very difficult to predict accurately.

<a name="WhatArePredictedEffectsOfClimateChange"></a>
<h3>What are the predicted effects of climate change</h3>
It is impossible to exactly predict all effects of climate change because it is
dependent on <a href="HowMuchWillTemperatureRise">How much will temperature rise</a>.
The effects do not increase linearly with temperature rise and are actually much
worse as the temperatures get higher.
<p>
Commonly listed fairly direct effects are:

Changing temperatures</a></li>
<li> 
<a href="https://archive.epa.gov/climatechange/kids/impacts/signs/acidity.html">
Ocean acidification</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="HowManyContributorsAreNeeded"></a>
<h3>How many people must contribute</h3>
The number of people that must contribute is impossible to say for certain because the
effects of climate change are dependent on the amount of change of temperature rise and
the amount of ocean acidity. See <a href="#WhatArePredictedEffectsOfClimateChange">
What Are Predicted Effects Of Climate Change</a> and 
<a href="HowMuchWillTemperatureRise">How much will temperature rise</a> for some of the reasons.

<h3>Are there other examples?</h3>
Humans have failed in the past. <a href="https://rainforests.mongabay.com/09easter_island.htm">Easter Island</a>
, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island">wikipedia/Easter Island</a>
But they have also succeeded. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer">Ozone Layer</a>
<p>
There is still hope to mitigate the effects of climate change.
