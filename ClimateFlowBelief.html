If you got here, I assume this means that the climate may or may not be changing, but nothing
needs to be done about it.
<p>
In many cases, actions that an individual can take to help reduce the chance of climate change
also correlate to the individual saving money. Many costs go along with the amount of energy
used to create a purchased good or product.

<h3>Only corporations or governments can help</h3>
The purchasing power of individuals impacts corporations. There are also other indirect
mechanisms such as insurance. One example:
<a href="https://unfriendcoal.com/insurance/">unfriendcoal.com/insurance/</a> and in
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/02/coal-power-becoming-uninsurable-as-firms-refuse-cover">www.theguardian.com/environment/...</a>. 
<p>
Changing opinions, educating people, and changing government regulations can have many effects. Climate change
is dependent on actions of billions of people.
Another example: <a href="https://www.planetizen.com/news/2018/01/96958-gov-jerry-brown-calls-five-million-zevs-california-roads-2030">
California HOV lanes</a> and <a href="https://www.planetizen.com/news/2018/09/100690-220000-ev-drivers-california-lose-carpool-lane-perk-2019">Losing HOV</a> and

<h3>I can help</h3>
The average American generates 4 times the amount of some countries and many more times
than that of other countries. In other words an American can reduce the most sometimes
quite easily. Nearly everybody can make choices about what to purchase.
<p>
There was the following article that lists many reasons that reducing CO2 from individuals would not
help. <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/12/climate-change-activists-are-focused-on-all-the-wrong-solutions/">
Climate change activists are focused on all the wrong solutions</a>. There is not one single thing that can
be done at the moment to solve the problem. But many fixes together can help.
<p>
Awareness is a big key and every bit helps.

You can calculate your carbon footprint with this calculator.
<a href="https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx">www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx</a>
<p>
The average CO2 emissions can be found here.

Good job. But there is always more that can be done. You may be able to change other people's minds and
can always improve your own actions.

<h3>Are there other examples?</h3>
Humans have failed in the past. <a href="https://rainforests.mongabay.com/09easter_island.htm">Easter Island</a>

But they have also succeeded. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer">Ozone Layer</a>

There is still hope to mitigate the effects of climate change.
